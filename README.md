### üîè Configure Elastic Beanstalk for HTTPS Access

1. Perform SSH connection to EC2 instanace for Backend Server (EC2 on AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
```
ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@<your-ec2-public-dns>
```
2. Update EC2 system and install required packages
```
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable epel
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```
3. Start and enable NGINX
```
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
4. Issue SSL certificate using Certbot with NGINX plugin
```
sudo certbot --nginx -d backend.ai-news-app.ip-ddns.com
```
5. Navigate to conf.d directory and create a new ssl.conf file
```
cd /etc/nginx/conf.d/
sudo vi ssl.conf
```
6. Enter the following code into the ssl.conf file
```
server {
          listen 443 ssl;
          server_name <full web server URL from cloudns>;

          ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/backend.ai-news-app.ip-ddns.com/fullchain.pem;
          ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/backend.ai-news-app.ip-ddns.com/privkey.pem;

          location / {
              proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
              proxy_http_version 1.1;
              proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
              proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
              proxy_set_header Host $host;
              proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
              proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          }
}
server {
          listen 80;
          server_name <full web server URL from cloudns>;
          return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```
7. Test NGINX configuration for syntax errors
```
sudo nginx -t
```
8. Reload NGINX to apply changes without downtime
```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### üë• Steps to Set Up AWS Cognito User Pool

1. Navigate to **Cognito** from the AWS Console
2. Click on "**Get started for free in less than five minutes**"
3. Click on "**Single-page application (SPA)**" under **Define your application**
4. Provide a "**name**" for your user pool under **Name your application**
5. Set Up Sign-in Options
   - Select how users will sign in (email, username, phone number, etc.).
6. Add a return URL
   - Enter the URL of the main React app by default
7. Click on **Create user directory**

#### Notes:

- Use the **User Pool ID** and **App Client ID** to integrate authentication into your app.  
- You can enable hosted UI or use SDKs (Amplify, AWS SDK) for sign-in, sign-up, and token handling.

---

## üì• Deployment Notes
- Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for backend deployment.
- Ensure proper IAM roles with DynamoDB read/write access are attached to backend EC2 instances.
- Frontend can be hosted via Amplify or static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- Configure DNS and SSL certificates for secure HTTPS access.
- Monitor Elastic Beanstalk environment health during deployments.

---

## üîó API Documentation (Brief)
### POST /analyze
- Submit article text for summary and entity detection.
- Request: JSON { "text": "article text" }
- Response: JSON containing summary, detected people, nationalities, and organizations.

### Authentication
- Uses AWS Cognito tokens (JWT) via OIDC.

---

## ‚úÖ Assumptions

- Users will upload or input news articles in 1-2 langauges.
- Input files are limited to `.txt` or `.docx` formats.
- Authentication is handled via AWS Cognito with valid JWT tokens.
- The backend AI service (Mistral API) is available and responsive.
- CloudNS domain and SSL certificates are properly configured for HTTPS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The AI summarization and entity detection accuracy depends on the quality of the input text.
- Legacy document files (.doc) will not be supported, as Mammoth is designed to convert .docx documents
- Formatting of the results may not be accurate 100% of the time, which may cause the results to be combined into one row (for people, country and organization)
- Large files or very long articles may result in slower processing or timeouts.
- Currently supports only people, nationalities, and organizations detection.
- User authentication relies on AWS Cognito.
- API rate limits apply based on Mistral AI‚Äôs free tier (1 request/second).
- HTTPS setup requires manual SSL certificate renewal unless automated.
- Deployment and DNS management require manual intervention. No auto-provisioning of resources.
